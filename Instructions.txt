First Insert The Entire Folder Into Your Python Folder Via These Steps:
1. Open Start Menu
2. Type Run (or search for the program called run and open it)
3. In the Run search bar, type in: %appdata%
4. It will open a folder in AppData called Roaming
5. Go back once and you will see the options: Local, Locallow, and Roaming
6. Open the Local Folder
7. Scroll down and open the Programs folder
8. Open the Python folder and select the python folder version you want to use. For example 'Python 36'
9. Open the Scripts folder
10. Copy and paste (or simply move) the entire 'Face-Recognition-Twitter-Bot-master' into the scripts folder
11. When you open VS Code, choose the 'Open Folder' option
12. Copy the folder location where you pasted the folder (where it says "AppData>Local>Programs... etc)
13. Paste it in VS Code's location bar and select and open the 'Face-Recognition-Twitter-Bot-master' folder
14. Click facerectwitter.py to your left to view and run the code

Extra Step:
Move the image file "Twitter Notif" wherever you want and copy the folder location (i.e. "User>Pictures>Twitter Notif.jpg")
If you don't want the picture to pop up, delete line 37 & 38


Make sure you have a developer Twitter account and you enter you account's keys to ensure it works

Install These Before Running Code:
pip install numpy
pip install twitter (or pytwitter)

If you get an error message saying "the term 'pip' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet..." install like this:
py -m pip install numpy
py -m pip install twitter (or pytwitter)
